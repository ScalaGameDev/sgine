Scala Engine for OpenGL-based Desktop, Android, and iOS game and business development.

Currently wraps around libgdx (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) to provide a powerful and functionally reactive Scala framework for developing applications.

**NOTE:** Use the `video` module with discretion as it depends on VLCJ (https://github.com/caprica/vlcj) currently and unless you have a commercial license, the open-source license is GPL. Additionally, the `video` module will currently only work on desktop implementations.
